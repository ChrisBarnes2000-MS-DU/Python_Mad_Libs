# Out Line for my Mad Libs Project

## Controls/Useability

You will be prompted to choose between making a (R)andomized madlib or a (C)ustimized one.

If custom is chosen, you will be prompted to enter different words or phrases in order to create a mad libs story

>### Your project must meet the below requirements in order to be considered passing

- [x] Provide a Mad Libs story for users to fill in
- [x] Collect user input for the words
- [x] Print the story with all blanks filled in by the userâ€™s words
- [x] Use at least 3 parts of speech for word replacement
- [ ] Use variable assignment to store/use values
- [x] Write and call functions
- [x] Use at least one of the following core data types: strings, integers, floats
- [ ] Use at least one of the following collection types: lists, tuples, dictionary

>### Stretch Challenges (Optional)

- [x] Handles improper user input
- [x] Story uses formatting and colors to provide a richer experience
- [x] The story uses 4+ parts of speech
- [ ] Randomize the words of the same type (ie shuffle the 5 nouns in terms of which noun blanks they go into).
- [ ] Use a list of words from a dictionary to generate words randomly if the user requests it.
- [ ] Tip: Mac/Linux has a dictionary words list located at /usr/share/dict/words
- [ ] Use a different data structure to store words.
- [ ] Build with test driven development (TDD)
- [ ] Use the system module (for accessing command-line arguments)
- [x] Add ASCII art/design to your story
- [ ] Take Mad Libs out of the terminal and have it running as a website
- [ ] Bonus: make it live by pushing to Heroku (or your place of choice)
